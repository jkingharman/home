My personal site. It's basically just a little blogging engine built on Sinatra.

# Why? #

I don't write enough anymore and wanted to help change that. My idea was to build the simplest workflow (for me) for blogging so that I'd want to write more. That means simply composing markdown in my IDE, versioning with git, and then publishing with `git push heroku master`.

I've kept the site's views simple on principle. When reading deeply, I like sites that get out the way, enhancing readability through white space and good typography.
