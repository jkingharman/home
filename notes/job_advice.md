title: Work advice
date: 04-01-2016

Call me a puritan but, decisions about work matter. According to growing evidence, work is a major factor of [well-being](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2234639?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). For many it's also the main source of [meaning](https://aeon.co/essays/what-is-better-a-happy-life-or-a-meaningful-one) in life. And we've long known that early decisions here are important since they tend to compound.

 Little of this research is surprising. It does, however, raise an interesting question. It's that if jobs are so clearly important why is career advice so shite?

I know it's bad because I've read my share. Career advice is littered with banality ("wash your hands before interview"), story (non-representative) and dubious prescription ("use Twitter to network!"). This makes it a lot like self-help writing generally. Above all, the goal is to inspire through story and calm through easy advice. Succour sells, but typically at the expense of less pleasant but more helpful advice.

If you doubt this, consider the following three pieces of advice. All are soft on the ears, extremely common and of questionable value.

**1. "Follow your passion"**

One piece of supposed career wisdom you often hear is, "follow your passion". [Steve Jobs](https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/), for example, was fond of saying this -- and it does sound nice. But a quick think shows it's too simple.

For one thing, many passions aren't marketable, and those that are are usually associated with winner-take-all markets. A recent [study](https://80000hours.org/articles/dont-follow-your-passion/) found that while 84% of students had passions, only 4% of those passions could become jobs. And even if this happens the [overjustification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect) effect may cause trouble: passions often becomes chains when done for money.

The deeper problem here, though, is the very idea of passion. For many it's seen as some pre-existing thing -- something you merely "find" by experimenting. Thus job markets that resemble high-stakes musical chairs. This view of passion though is naïve: people with strong passions rarely start out that way. More often, motivation grows over time as they commit to some activity.

Steve Job's advice obscure this fact, and hence encourages wasted years and pointless introspection.

 **2. "Pick according to personality"**

If not passion, how 'bout personality?

It's often said that matching personality -- who you are, what you're good at -- with a field is the best way to pick a job. Books like [What Colour is Your Parachute](https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Color-Your-Parachute-2016/dp/160774662X) are based on this idea, and many assume it's supported by hard reason.

Not so. [Decades of research](https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115567607.html) shows personality-environment fit doesn't well predict job success or enjoyment. Holland-type tests are thought to have power. But studies have found, at best, only very weak correlations here.

What's more, we know other general attributes that actually are strong predictors -- like [IQ](https://www.unc.edu/~nielsen/soci708/cdocs/Schmidt_Hunter_2004.pdf) and [working conditions](https://80000hours.org/2012/12/our-research-on-how-to-find-a-job-you-love/). Raw cognitive power is strongly correlated with success across many careers. And it's the work's character, much more than your own, that predicts job satisfaction. Personality just isn't that important.

**3\. "Work in a non-profit"**

Last, there's the advice for do-gooders. People wanting to make a difference are often told to seek "ethical" careers. By this, it's usually meant that you should work in charity, or else maybe medicine.

Possibly. But I'd think twice here. Studies show many non-profits have [derisory performance](https://www.givewell.org/giving101/Accomplishing-Nothing). And among even the better, it's unclear whether staff help the world more than (say) entrepreneurs. There's also [replaceability](https://80000hours.org/2012/01/just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice/) to ponder: if you get a non-profit job, and your only marginally better than the second-best candidate would have been, in what sense exactly are you making a big difference?

Arguably, you're not. Likely, in fact, you're better off in other sectors -- even consulting or finance, surprisingly. For-profit jobs like these are skills and capital gold dust. If you can stomach them they allow you to build such goods fast, which sets you up to aid a cause more effectively later on. [Better non-profits](https://80000hours.org/2015/09/what-do-leaders-of-effective-non-profits-say-about-working-in-non-profits-interviews-with-givedirectly-deworm-the-world-initiative-development-media-international-schistosomiasis-control-initiativ/) know this: it's partly why they often advise smart and driven grads to *avoid* working in their sectors right out the gate.

In saying all this, I'm not picking holes idly. The extent of bad career advice is a real puzzle to me. 

The puzzles immediate explanation, of course, is simply low demand for better advice. But this answer just pushes the question back: given how important careers are, *why don't we **want** better advice?*

Anecdotally, very few of my friends researched their work with care -- even when entry cost them a lot in time and energy. It's not hard to ring (e.g.) a lawyer or carer to see what the work's like really, yet no one I know did this. Similarly, it's [easy](https://www.onetonline.org/) to find key [job stats](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) -- for example, [medium income](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2015provisionalresults) -- but few ever do.

So what's going on? That people aren't very motivated to learn about a really important part of their lives makes me think doing so carries a big downside. But I can't see it -- what am I missing here?
