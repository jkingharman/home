title: Job Advice
date: 04-01-2016


Call me a puritan, but, decisions about work matter. According to growing evidence, work is a major factor of well-being. For many, it's also the main source of meaning in life. And we've long known that early decisions here are important since they tend to compound.   Little of this research is surprising. It does, however, raise an interesting question. It's that if jobs are so clearly important, why is career advice so bad?
 
I know it's bad because I've read my share. Career advice is littered with banality (wash your hands before interview), story (non-representative), and dubious prescription (use twitter to network!). This makes it a lot like self-help writing generally. Above all, the goal is to inspire through story and calm through easy advice. Succour sells, but typically at the expense of less pleasant but more helpful counsel.  
If you doubt this, consider the following three pieces of advice. All are soft on the ears, extremely common, and of questionable value.
 
1. Follow your passion  
One piece of supposed career wisdom you often hear is, follow your passion. Steve Jobs, for example, was fond of saying this  and it does sound nice. But a quick think shows it's over simple.  
For one thing, many passions aren't marketable, and those that are are usually associated with winner-take-all markets. A recent study found that while 84% of students had passions, only 4% of those passions could become jobs. And even if this happens, the overjustification effect may cause trouble: passions often becomes chains when done for money.
 
The deeper problem here, though, is the very idea of passion. For many, it's seen as some pre-existing thing  something you merely find by experimenting. Thus job markets that resemble high-stakes musical chairs. This view of passion, however, is naive: people with strong passions rarely start out like so. More often, motivation grows over time as they commit to some valuable activity.
 
Steve Job's advice obscure this fact, and hence encourages wasted years and futile introspection.
 
â€¨2. Pick according to personality  
If not passion, how about personality?
 
It's often said that matching personality  who you are, what you're good at  with a field is the best way to pick a job. Books like What Colour is Your Parachute are based on this idea, and many assume it's supported by hard reason.  
Not so. Decades of research shows personality-environment fit doesn't well predict job success or enjoyment. Holland-type tests are thought to have power. But studies have found, at best, only very weak correlations here.  
What's more, we know other general attributes that actually are strong predictors  like IQ and working conditions. Raw cognitive power is strongly correlated with success, across many careers. And it's the work's character, much more than your own, that predicts job satisfaction. Personality just isn't that important.
 
3. Work in a non-profit
 
Last, there's the advice for do-gooders. People wanting to make a difference are often told to seek ethical careers. By this, it's usually meant that you should work in charity, or else maybe medicine.  
Possibly. But I'd think twice here. Studies show many non-profits have derisory performance. And among even the better, it's unclear whether staff help the world more than (say) entrepreneurs. There's also replaceability to ponder: if you get a non-profit job, and your only marginally better than the second-best candidate would have been, in what sense exactly are you making a big difference?
 
Arguably, you're not. Likely, in fact, you're better off in other sectors  even consulting or finance, surprisingly. For-profit jobs like these are skills and capital gold dust. They allow you to build such goods fast, which sets you up to aid a cause more effectively later on. Better non-profits know this: it's partly why they often advise smart and driven grads to avoid working in their sectors at first. 
 
***  
In saying all this, I'm not picking holes idly. The extent of bad career advice is a real puzzle, to me. 
 
The puzzles immediate explanation, of course, is simply low demand for better advice. But this answer just pushes the question back: given how important careers are, why don't we want better advice?  
Anecdotally, very few of my friends researched their work with care  even when entry cost them a lot in time and energy. It's not hard to ring (e.g.) a lawyer or carer to see what the work's like really, yet no one I know did this. Similarly, it's easy to find key job stats  for example, medium income  but few ever do.
 
So what's going on? That people aren't very motivated to learn about a hugely important part of their lives makes me think doing so carries a big downside. But I can't see it  what am I missing here?
